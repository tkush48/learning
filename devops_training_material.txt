Best Practices (multi-stage builds)


AWS
Compute: EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS
Networking: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, NAT Gateway, Load Balancer
Storage: S3, EBS, EFS
IAM: Roles, Policies
Monitoring: CloudWatch
Others: Route 53, RDS, Auto Scaling


1. RDS Connection Issues
Symptoms: Application cannot connect to RDS instance.
Checks & Fixes:
Verify Security Group allows inbound traffic on DB port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
Ensure VPC/Subnet routing is correct (private vs public).
Check DNS resolution for RDS endpoint.
If using IAM auth, confirm token validity and SSL settings.
 
 
2. High CPU Utilization
Symptoms: CPU spikes during peak traffic.
Checks & Fixes:
Use Performance Insights to identify slow queries.
Add Read Replicas for read-heavy workloads.
Optimize queries and indexes.
Scale up instance class or switch to Provisioned IOPS storage.
 
 
3. Storage Full
Symptoms: DB stops accepting writes.
Checks & Fixes:
Enable storage auto-scaling.
Clean up old data or logs.
Monitor CloudWatch metrics for Free Storage Space.
 
 
4. Slow Query Performance

Symptoms: Queries take longer than expected.
Checks & Fixes:
Analyze Performance Insights and slow query logs.
Tune parameter groups (e.g., innodb_buffer_pool_size).
Consider upgrading to io2 EBS volumes for better IOPS.
 
 
5. Multi-AZ Failover Issues
Symptoms: Failover takes too long or app disconnects.
Checks & Fixes:
Ensure DNS caching in app is low (TTL).
Validate connection retry logic in application.
Check CloudWatch events for failover triggers.
 
 
6. Backup Failures
Symptoms: Automated backups or snapshots fail.
Checks & Fixes:
Verify backup window does not overlap with heavy load.
Check IAM permissions for AWS Backup.
Ensure storage space is sufficient for snapshots.
 
 
7. Parameter Group Misconfiguration
Symptoms: DB crashes after parameter change.
Checks & Fixes:
Review parameter group changes before applying.
Use apply during maintenance window for risky changes.
Roll back to previous parameter group if needed.
 
 
8. SSL/TLS Connection Errors
Symptoms: App cannot connect after enabling SSL.
Checks & Fixes:
Ensure SSL certificates are updated.
Verify connection string includes SSL options.
Check parameter group settings for SSL enforcement.

 
Docker

Dockerfile: Instructions, CMD vs ENTRYPOINT, caching
Image vs Container: Immutable image vs running instance
Volumes: Persistent storage (named volumes, bind mounts)
Networking: Bridge, Host, Overlay
Docker Compose: Multi-container orchestration
Best Practices: Multi-stage builds, minimal base images, .dockerignore
 
Kubernetes
Network Policy: Pod-to-pod communication control
RBAC: Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles
Probes: Liveness, Readiness, Startup
HPA: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (CPU/memory/custom metrics)
Config Management: ConfigMaps, Secrets
Troubleshooting: kubectl logs, describe, Events, CrashLoopBackOff
